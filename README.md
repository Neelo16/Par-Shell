This highly advanced shell uses the latest advancements in paralel
processing techniques in order to allow the user
to open a (theoretically infinite) number of processes from within the shell.

# FAQ

## But how can you do these amazing things?

We looked long and hard to get the best team possible for the job.
After 10 minutes of asking around,
we managed to get 3 amazing wannabe engineers to work on this project.
This spectacular team managed to come up with the advanced algorithms 
required to this amazingly innovative product.

## Will I get a virus?

Yes.

## Really?

No. How about you shut up and go compile and run this already?
You could be having a life changing experience right now!

## But I really like to ask questions...

That's not a question.

# Serious talk
Jokes aside, this project was developed for the Operating Systems subject at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico. It consists of a shell that will run any program in the background (it must be provided with the full path).
